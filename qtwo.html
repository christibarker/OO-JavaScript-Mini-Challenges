	Create an Album object that can contain many Photo objects in its photos attribute. 

	Each Album should allow you to add a new Photo,

	 list all Photos, and 

	 access a specific Photo by the order it was added. 

	 Each Photo should store the photo's file name (path) and the location (place in world) the photo was taken in as strings. 

	 Create instances of each object defined to prove that your object model works.
